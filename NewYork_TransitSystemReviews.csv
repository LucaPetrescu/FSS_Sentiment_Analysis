6,Very useful during our trip to NY
7,"So far, so good"
8,Very accurate
9,Helped me a lot!
10,Perfect app for New York City!!!
11,"Never has accurate bus or train times. They either take way longer, show up way earlier, or never actually show."
12,A life-saver for anyone visiting New York City.
13,Great app! It's very accurate. I depend on it when subway station train status displays are not working.
14,"Although this app has been VERY helpful with traveling in the city, there are times I'm unsure if it's working or not. An example is when I leave work in the late night and before I leave, I see a time for the next bus. When I leave, it changes (usually dropping the real-time tracking, too)."
15,I updated the app NOW and it no longer works. It loads intro and then goes black screen and stays that way. It was a great app and now I can't use it anymore.
16,I just updated the app and now it won't work for me. It gets stuck on a white screen then closes itself out.
17,Well it did work great until last update you have now screwed the goose it doesnt even load anymore
18,Excellent
19,Beat app so far
20,Amazing
21,THE ARRIVAL TIMES INDICATED ARE NEARLY PERFECT.
22,Great
23,Easy to use.
24,This app makes my movements so stress-free and convenient
25,Quick thank you
26,Difficult to navigate
27,"Good app... but MTA sucks, so what can you do? I know it's not an MTA app, btw."
28,"First time using the app,very easy to use and very helpful!"
29,Great app. Would recomend!
30,4 stars. Accurate info but you didn't tell me about the pick up only buses. Ugh. Also I should be able to view due future trips so i can plan ahead. Otherwise it's a great app.
31,Right on target.
32,Very good
33,"My best app it keeps me tune in with the time when I'm to leave the house and be at the bus stop, Only thing I don't like is at times they be charging the time back and forth while waiting on the bus to come, Otherwise good service"
34,Any cituation with the trains always is shuttle bus. Thank you
35,"Love NYC transit app works very well, no problems with the bus info"
36,This is a good app because even if I'm in a heri I can just open tye app and see my bus or tran and it helps me with otyer stuff.
37,very detailed and includes train and railroad updates
38,Always up to date
39,Very accurate
40,Kickass app
41,Good
42,Overall great but has some serious usability issues requiring getting used to. 1) why are downtown and uptown arrivals all grouped together on one list on the schedule page. Keeping them separated would be more useful - i only want to go one direction. Also i don't much care about arrivals in 60 minutes in the future 2) shorten load times and 3) have a quick way of looking up a schedule for the current station using gps location. Like a shortcut on the main page. Thanks!
43,I love this app! It's eerily accurate. Thrilled that I found it.
44,Great app. Easy to use.
45,I can always find what I need with your schedule.
46,Excellent
47,Very useful! The best yet!
48,very good
49,App. is very good to have. Schedule times for any trains arrival is 99% accurate.......
50,Exceptional
51,Thank you
52,This app has changed many features making it difficult to use. It's not the same.
53,Shows us delays
54,Amelework regassa @076
55,Grate app just as stated
56,I use it every day
57,Its always accurate from what i exeperienced.
58,First time in New York and this app has been a great help in getting around the Big Apple
59,Excellent service
60,MTA IN NYC IS THE WORST AND THIS APP PROVES IT BY SHOWING ALL OF THE DELAYS MTA HAS TO OFFER
61,Easy and efficient
62,Bus is better than the train. Thank You.
63,Great
64,"Very Helpful , Excellent"
65,Real good help
66,Excellent
67,Splendid! informative!
68,"I really like this app. I have been using it for years. It helps me to know the schedule and any delays and directions to where I am going. Tried other apps, but they're usually ad riddled and not as accurate as My Transit NYC. Great app updating this same review as of 11/2023 and still happy with My Transit NYC subway app."
69,Reliable medium of travelling.
70,Very accurate. I lnow when to expect the next bus; the closest stops to get on and off.
71,"Bad interface, too many ads"
72,"Vast improvement over previous NYC Transit apps. Still missing one thing: ""how long until the next bus"" should be one click, not 3."
73,Excellent
74,Very functional and reliable
75,Very Good App ..No Problems...No Complaints.... More Reliable
76,Worthless. With ads
77,I like this app alot.
78,"Instead of receiving feedback within app., you get redirects or soliciting for cash upgrades. Hint to users: a VERY tiny ""skip"" prompt, allows you to open app with a upgrade charge. Didn't even get explanation on alerts... Instead getting a app notice before a redirect back to starting point."
79,"Intuitive, comprehensive, and good graphics."
80,So practical!
81,On Point
82,"Easy to use, got us everywhere we wanted to go!!"
83,Absolutely no point in downloading this app. IDK how it has good reviews but it is almost never accurate. It will give an actual countdown for when the bus is coming and still be wrong.
84,Great app for getting around New York
85,It's fantastic
86,Paid for pro version last year now it's gone...now they want me to pay monthly for subscription.
87,Good app just needs more twik
88,Fine

95,Fake app that is essentially trying to scam you. Shameful
96,I appreciate it because it give changes alerts too
97,"Amazing app, easy to use and understand"
98,"An Invaluable Tool for Navigating NYC Transportation ""Used My Transit NYC and Subway App to navigate NYC's transit system—an invaluable tool for newcomers and tourists. Provides detailed, clear instructions, simplifying complex routes. It made my NYC journey smoother and less intimidating. Essential for efficient city navigation. Great appreciation to the creators!"""
99,Great
100,"This application is tracking your every move, pulling every bit of information about your device, what's stored on it, all of your apps, where you live and work, what websites you like to visit and everything about you then providing it to anyone it wants. It's disgusting and unnecessary. It's time for people in this city to wake up and stop installing this garbage application as well as ONMY, the biggest privacy nightmare on this entire store."
